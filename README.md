First Ascension Perk - What sort of strategy do we want to aim for?

# Star Log
Important events:
- found an alien named Listhima (a Kobarian) on a ruined ship, in exchange for technical assistance she was allowed refuge on Earth. For some unknown reason the people of Earth then elected her president of the UN.

- one alien contact - the Ozkol Republic. They are democratic crusaders, and not currently crowding us, although we are currently occupying the strand of systems linking our respective regions of the galaxy with an eye towards occupying (and militarizing) the crossroads system at the end of the strand.

- discovered signs of a precursor civilization known as "the Yuht," as well as several sites of theirs. Have not explored those sites in earnest.

- there are symbiots of an unknown origin on formerly inhabited planet not far from Sol, and a proposed research project to study them.

**2216.01.10**  Accepted Defensive Pact with the Ozkox.  
**2216.07.03**  Accepted Migration Treaty with the Ozkox.  
**2217.11.26**  Expanded into Menok.  Prioritizing expansion towards the Ozkox, in order to block them off.  
**2218.02.02**  Made contact with the Uv-Xantt Sovereignty.  Xenophobic, so probably not our best friends going forward.  
**2218.09.07**  Came across abandoned mining equipment.  Scrapped it for 329 minerals.  
**2218.11.02**  Discovered habitable size 19 planet in the Sirius system and plan to colonize as soon as possible.  
**2220.01.12**  Discovered a large ship in the atmosphere of a gas giant.  Attempted to salvage the ship.  
**2220.04.26**  Activated an abandoned communications beacon which contacted a group of human captives.  A group called the Ransomeers have captured them and we plan to rescue them.  
**2220.05.09**  Explorers from another galaxy called the Kohtalo made contact with us.  We warned them of danger at the Lathoros pulsar.  Not long after, their engines start up and they have vanished.  
**2220.07.02**  With some support from us, Listhimi is re-elected president.  
**2221.01.02**  Made contact with the Nock, an Artisan Troupe.  
**2221.04.27**  Colony ship landed on Sirius Prime.  
**2221.10.03**  After researching a neural symbiont found on Duhr II, we gave the lead scientist permission to attach herself as a host to one of the neural slugs.  
**2221.12.12**  Made contact with the Pallyrian Stellar Bloc, aggressive militarists.  
**2221.12.12**  The brain slug symbiontic experiment was successful, but we put a stop to this madness before the experimentation went to far.  
**2222.01.27**  The Pallyrian Stellar Bloc declared the Ozkox Republic their rival.  
**2222.03.29**  Sending our fleet to confront the Ransomeers.  
**2223.01.18**  Successfully rescued the prisoners from the Ransomeer's starbase.  No casualties.  
**2223.06.06**  Accepted a research agreement with the Ozkox.  
**2224.05.09**  Made contact with the Jaazijan Remnant, stagnant ascendancy.  They are blocking our expansion further to the north.  
**2224.10.02**  Void Cloud research completed, improving our tile physics output.  
**2225.04.07**  Made contact with the Tebrid Homologs.  They want to assimilate us.  
**2228.05.16**  Blue Laser researched, continuing to focus on laser weapon technology.  
**2228.06.03**  A plague has broken out on Sirius Prime and a citizen has been assigned to the plague research center in order to find a cure.  
**2228.07.16**  The plague on Sirius Prime has been cured and a memorial erected in memory of the ones who died.
